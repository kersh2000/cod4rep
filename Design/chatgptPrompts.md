With this plan in place, you can ask for details on any specific phase or task as you move through the project. I'll be here to provide tutorials and guidance whenever you need help!

==================================
=


Let’s dive into **Phase 1: Concept and Planning**, breaking it down into manageable steps while covering tools and strategies for keeping track of your progress. You’re not overthinking it at all! It’s smart to start organized so you can avoid chaos later in the project.

### **Phase 1: Concept and Planning (1-2 weeks)**

---

### **Step 1: Define Core Gameplay Mechanics**

This is where you clearly define the most important aspects of your game, such as movement, shooting, AI behavior, and respawn systems. At this stage, you’re thinking about the overall vision for your game.

1. **Decide on basic gameplay mechanics**:
   - Player movement: walking, sprinting, jumping, crouching, etc.
   - Shooting mechanics: types of weapons, aiming (simple vs. scoped), bullet physics.
   - Health system: how much health does each player and bot have?
   - AI behavior: should bots just patrol, or actively hunt the player?

2. **Write down these ideas** in a document to form the basis of your design:
   - Use a **text document** or **markdown (.md)** file for simplicity (you can open it in any text editor or version control system).
   - Example tools: **VSCode**, **Google Docs**, or even **Notion** for more structured note-taking.

#### **Directory Setup (First Step)**
   - Create a project directory on your local machine (e.g., `CoD_Replica_Project`).
   - Inside this directory, create a folder called `design_docs` where all your design-related files will go.
   - Example:
     ```
     CoD_Replica_Project/
     ├── design_docs/
     │   ├── core_gameplay_mechanics.md
     │   └── game_features.md
     ```

---

### **Step 2: Analyze Core Requirements**

Now that you have a vision for the gameplay, it’s time to break down the **technical requirements** for achieving that vision. This is about figuring out what tools, game engines, languages, and libraries you’ll need to make everything work.

1. **Choose a Game Engine**:
   - Unity (C#) or Unreal Engine (C++). 
   - Unity is easier to start with, especially for prototyping, so I suggest Unity unless you’re comfortable with C++.

2. **Decide on AI and Physics**:
   - **AI**: You’ll need basic enemy bots that can navigate the map, detect the player, and engage in combat. Unity’s **NavMesh** or Unreal’s **Behavior Trees** can handle this.
   - **Physics**: Unity and Unreal have built-in physics engines for collisions, bullets, etc.

3. **Tools/Technologies for Asset Creation**:
   - **Blender**: Free and great for modeling low-poly environments.
   - **GIMP** or **Krita**: Free software for creating textures and 2D assets.

4. **Tracking Core Requirements**:
   - Create another markdown file (`core_requirements.md`) in your `design_docs` folder where you track your software choices, tool decisions, and why you chose them.

Example structure:
```
CoD_Replica_Project/
├── design_docs/
│   ├── core_gameplay_mechanics.md
│   ├── core_requirements.md
```

---

### **Step 3: Create a Game Design Document (GDD)**

This is where you create a detailed **Game Design Document (GDD)** that serves as the blueprint for your project. It’s a living document that can evolve as you develop the game. The GDD outlines the game's features, objectives, level ideas, art style, and overall vision.

#### What should the GDD include?

1. **Overview**:
   - A short summary of the game you’re making. This could be as simple as:
     > "A first-person shooter set in a small multiplayer map with bots as enemies. Players will engage in combat, take damage, and respawn after dying. The AI bots will patrol and engage the player."
   
2. **Core Features**:
   - List the core features of the game: movement, shooting, AI behavior, map design, respawn system, HUD, etc.
   
3. **Technical Details**:
   - Outline the game engine you’re using, programming languages, and any additional libraries or assets required.

4. **Level Design**:
   - High-level description of the maps you plan to create.
   - Include sketches or basic 2D layouts of the level ideas if possible.

5. **Milestones**:
   - Set some basic goals, like when you’ll finish the prototype, when the first bot will be added, etc.

#### Storing the GDD:
   - Save the GDD as a **markdown file** (`game_design_document.md`) in your `design_docs` folder.
   - If you prefer a richer document, you can use **Google Docs** for collaborative editing.

Example:
```
CoD_Replica_Project/
├── design_docs/
│   ├── core_gameplay_mechanics.md
│   ├── core_requirements.md
│   └── game_design_document.md
```

### **Step 4: Set Up Version Control (Git) for Tracking Progress**

You’re not overthinking it! **Using Git for version control** is a smart move, especially for a multi-phase project like this. Here’s how to keep track of your files and progress:

1. **Initialize a Git Repository**:
   - Inside your project directory, initialize a git repository by opening Git Bash and running:
     ```bash
     git init
     ```

2. **Add Your Design Docs**:
   - Track your design documents with Git:
     ```bash
     git add design_docs/
     git commit -m "Add initial design documents"
     ```

3. **Commit Regularly**:
   - As you make changes to your GDD or design docs, commit those changes regularly:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Updated core gameplay mechanics"
     ```

4. **Optional: Set Up Remote Backup (GitHub or GitLab)**:
   - If you want a remote backup of your project, create a repository on **GitHub** or **GitLab** and push your local commits to the cloud:
     ```bash
     git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
     git push -u origin master
     ```

---

### **Step 5: Organize Files and Track Progress**

1. **Project Directory Structure**:
   - You want a clean, organized structure from the start. Here’s an example of what your folder structure should look like by the end of Phase 1:
     ```
     CoD_Replica_Project/
     ├── design_docs/
     │   ├── core_gameplay_mechanics.md
     │   ├── core_requirements.md
     │   ├── game_design_document.md
     ├── .git/
     ├── README.md
     └── LICENSE (optional)
     ```

2. **README File**:
   - Create a `README.md` at the root of your project to describe the project and its current status.
   - Example:
     ```markdown
     # Call of Duty Replica Project
     This project aims to recreate a small multiplayer map from Call of Duty with simple FPS mechanics and AI-controlled bots.

     ## Current Progress:
     - Phase 1: Planning in progress.
     ```

---

### **Tracking Your Progress**:
1. **Use Git for Milestones**:
   - Every time you finish a significant part of your planning, make a **git commit** to track that milestone.
   - Example commit messages:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Completed core gameplay mechanics outline"
     git commit -m "Added AI bot requirements"
     ```

2. **Optional: Project Management Tools**:
   - If you want a more visual way to track progress, consider using **Trello** or **Notion** to create tasks and move them through phases (Planning, Prototyping, Development, etc.).

---

### **Summary for Phase 1**:

1. **Define Core Gameplay Mechanics**: Write out all key features (player movement, shooting, AI behavior, health, respawn, etc.).
2. **Analyze Core Requirements**: Select the game engine, tools, and libraries you'll use.
3. **Create the GDD**: Organize all the design, technical, and gameplay details into a Game Design Document.
4. **Set Up Version Control (Git)**: Track your files and progress using Git. Optional: Create a remote repository on GitHub or GitLab.
5. **Organize Files and Directory**: Keep your design docs, progress, and assets organized for future phases.
